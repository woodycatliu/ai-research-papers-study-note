## Abstract

Provence is an efficient context pruner designed for question-answering applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). It addresses computational overhead and irrelevant information propagation issues in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm by removing irrelevant content from retrieved contexts before LLM generation.

## Key Contributions

1. **Context Pruning as Sequence Labeling**: Formulates context pruning as a sequence labeling task where the model outputs binary labels for each word/sentence
2. **Unified Pruning and Reranking**: Performs both tasks in a single forward pass, significantly reducing computational costs
3. **Multi-domain Training**: Trained on diverse domain data for out-of-the-box applicability

## Methodology

### Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: Fine-tuned DeBERTa model
- **Training Data**: MS MARCO document ranking collection (370k queries) and Natural Questions (87k queries)
- **Label Generation**: Silver labels generated using Llama-3-8B-Instruct

### Technical Details
- Formulates context pruning as binary sequence labeling
- Combines pruning and reranking in single inference
- Outputs relevance scores for context segments
